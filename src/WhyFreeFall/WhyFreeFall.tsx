                        <div className="info-text-box"><p className="info-text">There are not many things I hate, but number one probably takes the fact that we can lose agency even over our most valued thoughts and beliefs. There is lots of unfairness we need to talk about, to spread not only the word, but whole essays containing the utter nonsense that most if not all minorities have to deal with.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            Thus emerged movements and protests and projects and so many times we saw hope in the media and television and we thought someone cares and spreads the message to the masses while all they care about is profit. So the respectable movement becomes a caricature of sorts. It resembles awareness we want and need, but it's there only to sell stuff and do the bare minimum of research if any at all.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            It's an ancient problem at this point, but I like to think there has to be something. There's not a problem in this world without a solution. The movement belongs to people, not to corporations and billionaires. It should remain there. When we fight for somebody or something precious, unprotected and vulnerable, it should get outside, screaming into the human conscience "This is wrong". And it should be told properly, truthfully and with care by person for person, not by corporation for money.


                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            This may not be much, barely an idea to be honest, but if it helps somehow,  even a little bit, I can die with the thought I did something.


                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            The idea is that when this staple, that is "PERSON NOT AN AD" is put on a logo of your movement, project or whatever help you offer, everyone who sees the staple in the hands of big corporations' marketing strategies knows that it does not align with the true beliefs and fights of the issue. It basically tells people watching the ad or touching the physical product, "No, this is not what we stand for. It is potential misinformation and it does not represent lives, dignity and equity that this banner stands for."


                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            If we incorporate this to the symbols and let it sit for a while, others with the same or similar mindset get to know the movement with this part already ingrained with it, only then is it going to work. So much so, that when someone uses photoshop or whatever to erase the staple from the symbol or just omits it altogether, others who see these advertisements will recognise that something is missing, at least. Symbols were always great parts of revolutions and fights for human rights, it pains me to see them humiliated like that.

                            <br/>

                            LGBTQIA+ is more than a rainbow lipstick from Sephora and self-care is more than just an overpriced yoga set. Fight for Gaza is more than a watermelon t-shirt made in China and Congolese women's torture is more than a flag from amazon.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            I love that we want to show support through proudly wearing these symbols and informing others about the issues, but I cannot unsee large golden bricks behind the curtains. These are issues that should not bring someone wealth and glory. Many times I wonder how many families could escape to Egypt for the money from sold shirts and pins calling for a ceasefire.

                            You are a PERSON, not an ad.
